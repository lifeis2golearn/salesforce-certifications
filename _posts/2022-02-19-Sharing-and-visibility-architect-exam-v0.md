<p>I passed the Salesforce Sharing and Visibility Designer (Salesforce Sharing and Visibility Architect) exam in January 2021. <em>This is the 4th article in the series of certifications journey leading to achieving Application Architect credentials.</em> I’m sharing my experience, with the thought that this might help other aspirants.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Udemy Course - </strong>In addition to all the resources mentioned in my first post, for this exam, I bought <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/salesforce-certified-sharing-and-visibility-designer-course/" target="_blank">Salesforce Certified Sharing and Visibility Designer Course</a> - a Udemy course by Walid El Horr. It is very useful w.r.t. exam and also covers all exam topics well. I found that it fill the gaps that remained after going through Trailhead and Focus on Force. Udemy also provides the option to ask questions from the instructor. In my opinion, this course is completely worth your money. Udemy regularly offers discounts on their courses, including this one. I bought the course on discount. Also, there is 30-day money back guarantee - in case you don’t like the course.</li></ul>
