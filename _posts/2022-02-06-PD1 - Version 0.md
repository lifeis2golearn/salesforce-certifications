<p>I cleared Salesforce platform developer I exam in September 2019. <em>This is the 2nd article in the series of certifications journey leading to achieving Application Architect credentials.</em> I had this thought in my mind that I’ll surely share my experience, when I clear this exam. This might help other aspirants. Like they say, <em>Better late, than never</em>. More than two years later, here it is…</p>

<p><strong>Pre-preparation experience</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I worked on Salesforce mostly using SOAP API, knew a bit SOQL, very little SOSL and worked on a very basic managed package. I was aware of some of the core standard objects like Contacts, Accounts, Opportunities etc. I knew about layouts, custom fields, a bit about profiles.</p>

<p><strong>Learning during exam preparation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>:   I started with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/users/strailhead/trailmixes/prepare-for-your-salesforce-platform-developer-i-credential#" target="_blank">Platform Developer I</a> trailmix on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com" target="_blank">Trailhead</a>, but didn't finished it to 100%. I left the advanced Apex topics like Async Apex and modules/trails related to Aura components. Based on my limited Salesforce experience, I found those very difficult to understand. I'm in no way discouraging anyone to finish the trail. I would still say, cover as much as you can.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>:   Start reading <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_dev_guide.htm" target="_blank">Salesforce Apex developer guide</a>. It was a 3000+ pages long PDF in summer 2019, version 46. Now it is 600+ pages, so it's much easy to cover now. I suggest to download in PDF format <a href="https://resources.docs.salesforce.com/236/latest/en-us/sfdc/pdf/salesforce_apex_developer_guide.pdf">Apex Developer Guide (PDF)</a>, so you can underline and highlight important things, and revisit important parts, when needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I read the PDF easily on my tablet and phone during office commute and sometimes, when I was having lunch or when in long queues. I used PDF marker to highlight important points that I can quickly go through near the exam time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make section wise notes, according to exam guide.</p>
