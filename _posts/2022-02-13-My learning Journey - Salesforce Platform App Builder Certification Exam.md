<p>I cleared Salesforce platform app builder certification in July 2020. <em>This is the 3rd article in the series of certifications journey leading to achieving Application Architect credentials.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are 3 super-badges recommended for Platform App Builder exam - completing all the three provides a great understanding of Salesforce tools/features.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only for the purpose of certification, but in my opinion, it provides practical knowledge as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Superbadge:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/superbadges/superbadge_security" target="_blank">Security Specialist</a></li><li>Superbadge:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/superbadges/superbadge_process_automation" target="_blank">Process Automation Specialist</a></li><li>Superbadge:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/superbadges/superbadge_lightning_platform_app_builder" target="_blank">App Customization Specialist</a></li></ul>

<p>I found this exam a bit difficult as I never worked on flows, process builder, workflow etc for work. But, I believe that is the purpose of Trailhead - to experience what you hadnâ€™t work on already.</p>
