<p>I passed the Salesforce Data Architect and Management Designer (Salesforce Data Architect) exam in November 2021. <em>This is the 5th and final article in the series of certifications journey leading to achieving Application Architect credentials.</em> I found this exam tougher, as it has many topics that need to be covered in depth. If you haven’t worked on those, it takes more time and effort to understand. It took me 4 months to study and then before exam day, I started revising all my notes 3 days before.</p>
