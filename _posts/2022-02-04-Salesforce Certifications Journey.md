<p>In November 2021, I covered one side of the pyramid, by achieving Application Architect certification. I appeared for 4 exams (in order) - </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For all of these exams - here are some generic suggestions. I’ll add my specific suggestions as well. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While preparing for these exams, my mind went through various questions, which I’m trying to answer here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"style":{"typography":{"fontSize":"18px"}}} -->
<p style="font-size:18px"><strong><strong><strong>How do I start my Salesforce Certifications journey?</strong></strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’m a software developer, so I started with Platform Developer I exam. After this exam, I had a lot questions in mind about different Salesforce topics. I wanted to learn more about Salesforce, so I started exploring the certification paths. I started with Application Architect side of the pyramid, as it was more aligned toward my current job role and my interests. I chose to go for Platform App Builder next. At work, for a requirement, I had to write triggers for sharing rules (programmatic sharing), which develop my interest in learning more about Sharing. I went for Sharing and visibility designer exam next. The last one to be done was Data Architecture and Management.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Suggestion</span></strong>: In my experience, the best way is to start with Platform App Builder or Platform Developer I, depending upon your background and comfort.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><strong>How to prepare for exams? What resources are needed? How costly it is?</strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Basics for all certifications:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Trailhead</strong></a> - Start with Trailhead. Trailhead has curated trails/ trail mixes for certification exams. Go through the Trail and take your time finishing it.<br><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Confession</span></em>: I never finished a trailmix completely, i.e. 100%, the nearest I got to completion was at 96% and the lowest was 82%.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/feed" target="_blank"><strong>Certification days</strong></a> - Check this section to see if any certification days are available for your exam. Usually, these are for beginner exams like PD - I, Admin exams, Platform App Builder etc. These sessions are coached by experts and they explain important topics from exam point of view as well as for deep understanding. You get a chance to ask questions via chat. You can even ask questions after the session and I’ve noticed that either the expert or your peers of the session would answer the questions. These happen on weekdays, so you have to take time off from work to attend. These are <strong>never</strong> recorded, so you can’t watch later, if you missed it. Point is, plan for this day and follow your plan. Plan to attend Certification days only when you are done with most of Trailmix, so you can understand the details and have more clarity. Certification days also give some discount coupons at the end, which you can use toward exam fee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cost</strong>: Platform Developer - I (PD I) and Platform App Builder (PAB) costs $200 USD. Architect level exams costs $400 USD. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><strong><strong>When should I book my exam?</strong></strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are appearing for PD I or Platform App Builder or Admin exam, book your exam date after attending certification days, so you can use your coupon toward exam fee. There is some time limit, in which you have to use the coupon - sometime like 3 months (might have changed, since I use it)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><strong><strong>How should I test my knowledge? How do I know, if I’m ready to sit in an exam?</strong></strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://focusonforce.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Focus on force</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Buy focus on force exams. Focus on force provides study material as well as mock exams to practice. The mock exams are based on per section and 2 or more complete exams as well. Keep in mind, you won’t get any question as such from these questions, however, you’ll need to focus on the explanation provided for the questions to understand the concepts. I’ve bought study material for only one exam, but used tests for all the exams. Focus on force occasionally provide discount on their materials, like towards thanksgiving etc.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://quizlet.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Quizlet</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people create quizlets, but my experience is that questions are good, but you can’t rely on the answers. So use your judgment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Some concepts are too hard to grasp, where should I look for help?</strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here comes the other resources to the rescue -</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They have study groups discussions posted on YouTube. Their material is trusted and developed keeping in mind the exams. Go through the videos more than once or stop and absorb the info or however you like to study.</p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Prepare to read a lot of documentation. This link also points to webinars and expert led sessions. Use Salesforce website or trusted blogs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/trailblazer-community/feed" target="_blank"><strong>Community forums</strong></a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you need more clarity, join a few forums and ask our questions. Use twitter (many people have their Salesforce only twitter handle) - Salesforce community is very active and helpful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Exam Day</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Read each question twice. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Read each question <strong>very </strong>carefully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Onsite Exam</span></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Use the paper to keep a count of correct questions. I write 1-60 on paper and just put a tick, if I thought the question was correct. Why? I failed first exam for a few questions and could have spent time in what I know, instead of just randomly spending time on some long questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Draw data modeling diagram, wherever possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Draw objects to determine what kind of relationship is being asked for in the questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Online exam</span></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When preparing for exam, don't use paper to draw diagrams. Instead train your mind to interpret relationships or model.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can use inbuilt camera on your laptop (relaxation because of COVID)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Still have doubts</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Follow Salesforce people or handles on Twitter. For ex. follow&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://trailhead%20twitter/" target="_blank">@trailhead</a>. You’ll stay inspired, whenever losing heart or feeling low.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you clear all the 4 exams, you automatically earn Salesforce Certified Application Developer credential. WooHoooo!!!</p>
